# Device Current Consumption Optimization using Neural Networks

Notebook part of my Bachelor's Degree "Cost and Current Consumption Optimization for Mobile Smart Devices Aiding Oral Health", Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Polytechic Univeristy of Bucharest.

The purpose of this code is to optimize the current consumption of a smart toothbrush meant to collect data during the quality of the brushing during usage. Since this is a battery powered smart appliance for daily usage, current consumption is a critical parameter that needs to be reduced by all means possible.
The processing of the data of an external toothbrushing dataset, collected using the same sensors as for our current project and re-interpolated them to simulate various states of the sensors responsibile for the data acquisition.

The results are compared against a set of current consumption measurements, in order to find the best compromise: accuracy vs current consumption. The target is to obtain the smallest possible current consumption, while mantaining a model accuracy as high as possible.
